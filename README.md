# Blogger by Vi

## Description

In this assignmentm, I built and created a blogging website complete with light dark toggle, incomplete form warning and blog post genration. This project was a handful but I learned a lot, namely when it came to the functionality of bootstraps light and dark mode.


## Usage

Write up your inner most feelings and post them for yourself.

stack overflow was particularly helpful when I got stuck on the light and dark mode hiding within bootstrap within the html opening tag!
